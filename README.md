# alfred-bot
Alfred is a Discord bot build with [Discord.js](https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js/) that is easy to extend and very modular.
You can add him to your server by going to [this site](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=169912798778753025&scope=bot&permissions=2099200&response_type=code)

## Installing
In order to get Alfred working on your own local machine, you'll have to have the same dependencies setup as [Discord.js](https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js/)
is requiring. Otherwise, it's a classical `npm install` and then `npm start` to start him up.
